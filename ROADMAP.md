# ROADMAP.md — AgentHub Release Plan

> **Guiding principle:** Ship something real that solves one problem perfectly before expanding scope.
> The first release must create a "wow" moment: `agenthub deploy` works end-to-end.

## 🎯 v0.1 — "Foundation" (First Public Release)

> **Release criterion:** A developer can clone the repo, run `docker compose up`, write an `agenthub.yaml` for a LangGraph agent, run `agenthub deploy --target local`, and see their agent running with a registry entry automatically created — in under 15 minutes.

**Release name:** Foundation
**Target date:** Month 3 from project start
**Git tag:** `v0.1.0`

- ❌ Azure deployer (v0.3+ — community contribution welcome)
- ❌ Oracle Cloud, Render, Fly.io deployers (community)
- ❌ Training or fine-tuning pipelines (not AgentHub's scope)
- ❌ RAG pipeline builder (use Langflow/Dify for this)
