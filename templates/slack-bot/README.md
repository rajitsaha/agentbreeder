# Slack Bot Agent

Conversational Slack bot with channel-aware responses, thread management, knowledge base search, Jira ticket creation, and meeting scheduling.

## Prerequisites

- AgentBreeder CLI installed (`pip install agentbreeder`)
- Slack app created at [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com/apps) with Bot Token and App Token

## Quick Start

1. **Create a Slack app** and configure Bot Token Scopes: `chat:write`, `channels:read`, `channels:history`, `app_mentions:read`

2. **Configure secrets:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Slack tokens and API keys
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   garden validate && garden deploy --target local
   ```

Add channel filtering in the system prompt or configure allowed channels in your Slack app settings.

### Connect to Jira

Uncomment the Jira environment variables in `.env` and provide your Jira credentials.
