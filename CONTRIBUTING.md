# Contributing to AgentBreeder

AgentBreeder is an open-source platform for deploying, governing, and orchestrating enterprise AI agents. Every contribution — whether it's a new cloud deployer, a framework runtime, a community template, or a typo fix — makes the platform better for everyone.

Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) before diving in. It's the authoritative guide to how this codebase is structured and what the architecture principles are.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ (dashboard only)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

### Setup

```bash
# Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agentbreeder.git
cd agentbreeder

# Python environment
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
cp .env.example .env

# Start local services (Postgres, Redis)
docker compose up -d

# Verify everything works
pytest tests/unit/
agentbreeder --help

# Dashboard (optional)
cd dashboard && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Coding Standards

Full standards are in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). The essentials:

### Python
- Type hints on every function
- Pydantic for all data validation — no raw dicts
- `async` for all I/O — never block the event loop
- `logger.info(...)` instead of `print()`
- Never bare `except:` — always catch specific exceptions

```bash
ruff check . && ruff format .   # lint + format
mypy .                           # type checking
```

### TypeScript / React
- No `any` — type everything
- React Query for all API calls
- Tailwind CSS — no inline styles
- Always handle loading, empty, and error states

### Tests

Every feature needs:
- Unit tests (`tests/unit/`) — required
- Integration tests (`tests/integration/`) — required for API changes
- E2E tests (`tests/e2e/`) — required for dashboard changes

```bash
pytest tests/unit/                     # fast, no external deps
pytest tests/integration/              # requires docker compose up
pytest tests/e2e/ --headed             # Playwright
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html       # coverage report
```

Target: **85%+ coverage on changed files**. Tests must run in under 100ms each — mock all external dependencies.

### Before opening a PR

- [ ] `pytest tests/unit/` passes
- [ ] `ruff check . && ruff format .` clean
- [ ] `mypy .` clean
- [ ] New tests written for your changes
- [ ] If you changed `agent.yaml` schema → updated JSON Schema at `engine/schema/agent.schema.json`
- [ ] If you changed the DB schema → wrote an Alembic migration
- [ ] If you added a deployer or runtime → added to README supported stack table
- [ ] If you changed a CLI command → updated help text

PRs are reviewed within 48 hours. Changes to `engine/` require two maintainer approvals. All other changes require one.

## Extension Points

### Adding a Cloud Deployer

Cloud deployers live in `engine/deployers/`. Each is self-contained.

1. Read the interface: `engine/deployers/base.py`
2. Study the reference: `engine/deployers/gcp_cloudrun.py`
3. Create `engine/deployers/your_cloud.py` implementing:
   - `provision()` — create cloud infrastructure
   - `deploy()` — deploy the agent container
   - `health_check()` — verify the agent is running
   - `teardown()` — clean up all resources
   - `get_logs()` — stream agent logs
4. Register in `engine/deployers/__init__.py`
5. Add unit + integration tests
6. Add an example in `examples/`
7. Update the supported stack table in README

### Adding a Framework Runtime

Framework runtimes live in `engine/runtimes/`. Each abstracts one agent framework.

1. Read the interface: `engine/runtimes/base.py`
2. Study the reference: `engine/runtimes/langgraph.py`
3. Create `engine/runtimes/your_framework.py` implementing:
   - `validate()` — verify agent code is framework-valid
   - `build()` — generate Dockerfile and build image
   - `get_entrypoint()` — framework startup command
   - `get_requirements()` — Python dependencies
4. Add a working example in `examples/your-framework-agent/`
5. Register in `engine/__init__.py`
6. Add the framework name to `engine/schema/agent.schema.json` enum
7. Write unit tests

### Adding an Orchestration Strategy

1. Add the strategy to `VALID_STRATEGIES` in `sdk/python/agenthub/orchestration.py`
2. Add it to `OrchestrationStrategy` enum in `engine/orchestration_parser.py`
3. Add it to `engine/schema/orchestration.schema.json`
4. Implement `_execute_<strategy>()` in `engine/orchestrator.py`
5. Add the example in `examples/orchestration/`
6. Write unit tests

### Adding a Connector

Connectors live in `connectors/` and passively ingest external resources into the registry.

1. Read the interface: `connectors/base.py`
2. Create `connectors/your_tool/connector.py` implementing `scan()` and `is_available()`
3. Include a `README.md` with setup instructions
4. Write unit tests with mocked external API responses

### Seeding the Marketplace

The community template library is one of the highest-leverage contributions. A great template dramatically reduces time-to-first-agent for others.

A good template:
- Solves a real, specific use case (e.g. "GitHub PR reviewer", "Zendesk tier-1 support", "SQL analyst")
- Works out of the box with the example `.env` values substituted
- Includes a `README.md` explaining what it does, what credentials it needs, and how to customize it
- Has a tested `agent.yaml` with all required fields

Add templates to `examples/templates/` and open a PR with the label `marketplace:template`.
