"""microlearning-ebook-agent — Google ADK agent.

Takes a user-supplied topic, researches it via the generic web-search tool, and
produces a structured microlearning ebook (intro / lessons / quizzes / summary).
The synthesis is done by the model in its instruction-driven response. Tools
are resolved from the AgentBreeder tool registry — they are not domain-specific
to this agent:

  - tools/web-search       -> engine.tools.standard.web_search (Tavily)
  - tools/markdown-writer  -> engine.tools.standard.markdown_writer

The system prompt is also resolved from the prompt registry:

  - prompts/microlearning-system  -> ./prompts/microlearning-system.md

The AgentBreeder runtime wrapper (engine/runtimes/templates/google_adk_server.py)
loads ``root_agent`` from this file at startup.

Run interactively:
    adk run

Run via the AgentBreeder runtime wrapper (matches production):
    bash scripts/serve.sh
