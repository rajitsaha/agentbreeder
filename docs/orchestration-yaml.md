# orchestration.yaml Reference

`orchestration.yaml` is the Low Code configuration file for multi-agent pipelines. It defines the agent graph, routing strategy, shared state, and deployment target.

All strategies are supported by the Dashboard visual canvas (No Code) and the Python/TypeScript SDK (Full Code). All tiers share the same deploy pipeline and governance.

## Minimal Example

```yaml
name: support-pipeline
version: "1.0.0"
team: customer-success
strategy: router

agents:
  triage:
    ref: agents/triage-agent
    routes:
      - condition: billing
        target: billing
      - condition: default
        target: general
  billing:
    ref: agents/billing-agent
    fallback: general
  general:
    ref: agents/general-agent
```

## Full Spec

```yaml
# ── Identity ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
name: support-pipeline           # Required. Lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens.
version: "1.0.0"                 # Required. SemVer.
description: "Multi-agent support routing"  # Optional.

                                 #   router         — keyword/intent routing
                                 #   sequential     — chain (output feeds next)
                                 #   parallel       — all agents run concurrently
                                 #   hierarchical   — supervisor delegates
                                 #   supervisor     — supervisor plans + delegates
                                 #   fan_out_fan_in — parallel + merge agent

# ── Agents ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
agents:
  triage:                        # Agent name (used in routes and supervisor_config)
    ref: agents/triage-agent     # Registry reference (or registry://agents/... path)
    routes:                      # Optional. Only for router strategy.
      - condition: billing       # Keyword or intent label that triggers this route
        target: billing          # Name of agent to route to
      - condition: default       # "default" catches unmatched messages
        target: general
    fallback: general            # Optional. Agent to use if this agent errors.

  billing:
    ref: agents/billing-agent
    fallback: general

  general:
    ref: agents/general-agent

# ── Shared State ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
shared_state:                    # Optional. Defaults: type=session_context, backend=redis
  type: session_context          # session_context | dict | custom
  backend: redis                 # redis | in_memory | postgresql

# ── Supervisor Config ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Required for strategy: supervisor, hierarchical, fan_out_fan_in
supervisor_config:
  supervisor_agent: triage       # Agent that plans and delegates (supervisor/hierarchical)
  merge_agent: aggregator        # Agent that combines results (fan_out_fan_in)
  max_iterations: 3              # Max supervisor/worker loops (default: 3)

# ── Deploy ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
deploy:
  target: local                  # local | cloud-run | ecs-fargate | kubernetes
  resources:
    cpu: "1"
    memory: "2Gi"
```

## Strategies

### `router`

Routes each incoming message to one agent based on keyword or intent matching. The first matching `condition` wins; `default` is the catch-all.

```yaml
strategy: router
agents:
  triage:
    ref: agents/triage
    routes:
      - condition: billing
        target: billing
      - condition: refund
        target: billing
      - condition: default
        target: general
  billing:
    ref: agents/billing
  general:
    ref: agents/general
```

### `sequential`

Agents run in definition order. The output of each agent becomes the input to the next.

```yaml
strategy: sequential
agents:
  researcher:
    ref: agents/researcher
  summarizer:
    ref: agents/summarizer
  reviewer:
    ref: agents/reviewer
    fallback: summarizer
```

### `parallel`

All agents receive the same input and run concurrently. Results are returned as a list.

```yaml
strategy: parallel
agents:
  sentiment:
    ref: agents/sentiment
  topics:
    ref: agents/topics
  summary:
    ref: agents/summarizer
```

### `fan_out_fan_in`

Workers run in parallel; a merge agent combines their outputs into a single response.

```yaml
strategy: fan_out_fan_in
agents:
  sentiment:
    ref: agents/sentiment
  topics:
    ref: agents/topics
  aggregator:
    ref: agents/aggregator
supervisor_config:
  merge_agent: aggregator
```

### `supervisor`

A supervisor agent receives the task, delegates sub-tasks to workers (one at a time or concurrently), and synthesizes the final response.

```yaml
strategy: supervisor
agents:
  coordinator:
    ref: agents/coordinator
  researcher:
    ref: agents/researcher
  writer:
    ref: agents/writer
  reviewer:
    ref: agents/reviewer
supervisor_config:
  supervisor_agent: coordinator
  max_iterations: 5
```

### `hierarchical`

Like `supervisor` but with a fixed hierarchy: supervisor always delegates in a structured pattern rather than deciding dynamically.

## Agent References

Agents can reference any deployed agent via the registry:

```yaml
agents:
  billing:
    # Registry reference (recommended — versioned, audited)
    ref: registry://agents/billing-agent@v2.1

    # Short form (resolves to latest stable)
    ref: agents/billing-agent

    # Direct A2A endpoint
    ref: https://billing.internal.company.com

    # Local agent in the same workspace
    ref: ../../agents/billing-agent/agent.yaml
```

---

## Validation

```bash
# Validate against JSON Schema
garden orchestration validate orchestration.yaml

# Validate all orchestrations in a workspace
garden validate
```

Validation checks:
- `name` is lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens
- `version` is SemVer
- `strategy` is a known value
- At least one agent defined
- All route `target` values reference known agents
- All `fallback` values reference known agents
- `supervisor`/`hierarchical` have `supervisor_config.supervisor_agent`
- `fan_out_fan_in` has `supervisor_config.merge_agent`

---

## Full Code SDK

The Python and TypeScript SDKs produce orchestration.yaml-compatible output:

```python
from agenthub import Orchestration, Pipeline, FanOut, Supervisor

# Equivalent to the router example above:
pipeline = (
    Orchestration("support-pipeline", strategy="router", team="customer-success")
    .add_agent("triage",  ref="agents/triage")
    .add_agent("billing", ref="agents/billing")
    .add_agent("general", ref="agents/general")
    .with_route("triage", condition="billing", target="billing")
    .with_route("triage", condition="default", target="general")
)
pipeline.save("orchestration.yaml")   # identical to hand-written YAML
```

See [Full Code Orchestration SDK](orchestration-sdk.md) for the complete SDK reference.
