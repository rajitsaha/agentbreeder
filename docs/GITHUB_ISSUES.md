### Issue 1: Create 20+ Agent Templates for `garden init --template`

**Priority:** P0
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `templates`, `launch`

**Description:**
Create a library of high-quality, production-ready starter templates that users can scaffold with `garden init --template <name>`. Templates are the single most important driver of time-to-first-deploy. Every template must work on the first try with zero configuration beyond API keys.

Required templates:
- `customer-support` -- Zendesk MCP integration + RAG over product docs
- `code-review` -- GitHub MCP + Claude for PR review and suggestions
- `research-agent` -- Web search + summarization pipeline
- `data-analyst` -- SQL tool + chart generation
- `slack-bot` -- Slack MCP + conversational agent
- `email-triage` -- Email parsing + classification + routing
- `document-qa` -- RAG-based document question answering
- `sales-qualification` -- CRM integration + lead scoring
- `multi-agent-pipeline` -- Triage agent -> Specialist agent -> QA agent orchestration
- One template per supported framework: LangGraph, CrewAI, OpenAI Agents, Claude SDK, Google ADK

Each template must include:
- Working `agent.yaml` with sensible defaults
- README with setup instructions and architecture diagram
- At least one unit test
- Example `.env.example` with required secrets documented
- Screenshot or terminal output showing the template in action

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All 20+ templates pass `garden validate` without errors
- [ ] All templates deploy successfully with `garden deploy --target local`
- [ ] Each template has a README with < 5 minute setup instructions
- [ ] Each template includes at least one passing test
- [ ] `garden init --template` lists all templates with descriptions
- [ ] Templates are indexed in the registry for `garden search`

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks (2 engineers)

### Issue 2: Record "5-Minute Demo" Video

**Priority:** P0
**Labels:** `marketing`, `launch`

**Description:**
Create two demo assets that show AgentBreeder's end-to-end workflow:

1. **Terminal GIF** (asciinema or VHS): A 60-second recording showing:
   - `garden up` starting the local platform
   - `garden init --template customer-support` scaffolding an agent
   - `garden deploy --target local` deploying it
   - The agent responding to a test query
   - The dashboard showing governance (RBAC, cost, audit trail)

2. **YouTube video** (2 minutes): Narrated walkthrough covering the same flow with dashboard UI shown side-by-side. End with the three-tier visual (No Code / Low Code / Full Code).

The terminal GIF goes in the README hero section. The YouTube video is linked from the landing page and README.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Terminal GIF is < 5 MB and renders correctly on GitHub
- [ ] YouTube video is uploaded and public
- [ ] Both assets show a complete init -> deploy -> running agent flow
- [ ] Dashboard governance features (RBAC, cost, audit) are visible
- [ ] No secrets or credentials visible in recordings
- [ ] GIF is embedded in README.md hero section

**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 days (1 person)

### Issue 3: Write "Migrate from X" Guides

**Priority:** P0
**Labels:** `docs`, `seo`, `launch`

**Description:**
Write four migration guides targeting developers who already have agents deployed using other tools or ad-hoc methods. These guides serve dual purpose: SEO content and genuine onboarding help.

Guides to write:

1. **Migrate from LangChain Deployment** -- Show how to wrap an existing LangChain/LangGraph agent in `agent.yaml`, replace custom deployment scripts with `garden deploy`, and gain governance automatically. Include before/after code comparison.

2. **Deploy CrewAI Agents with Governance** -- Take a working CrewAI crew definition and show how AgentBreeder adds RBAC, cost tracking, and audit trail without changing the crew logic. Emphasize what they gain vs. running CrewAI standalone.

3. **Replace Custom Docker+Terraform with agent.yaml** -- For teams that built their own deployment pipeline. Show the lines-of-code reduction, the governance features they get for free, and the multi-cloud portability.

4. **Add RBAC to Existing OpenAI Agents** -- For teams using the OpenAI Agents SDK directly. Show how to wrap their agent, deploy it, and immediately get team-based access control and cost attribution.

Each guide should include:
- A realistic "before" scenario (with code)
- Step-by-step migration process
- "After" state showing AgentBreeder benefits
- Common pitfalls and troubleshooting
- Time estimate for migration

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All four guides are published in `docs/guides/`
- [ ] Each guide includes working code examples that pass `garden validate`
- [ ] Each guide has been tested end-to-end by someone other than the author
- [ ] Guides are linked from the main documentation index
- [ ] Each guide targets relevant SEO keywords in the title and headings

**Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks (1 person)

### Issue 4: Create Comparison Pages

**Priority:** P1
**Labels:** `docs`, `seo`

**Description:**
Create honest, factual comparison pages for SEO and developer decision-making. These pages should acknowledge competitors' strengths while clearly articulating AgentBreeder's differentiation.

Comparisons to write:

1. **AgentBreeder vs LangChain** -- Focus on: deployment (LangChain has none built-in), governance (none), multi-framework support (LangChain is LangChain-only), registry/discovery.

2. **AgentBreeder vs CrewAI** -- Focus on: deployment to production (CrewAI is dev-focused), governance, multi-cloud, MCP integration, registry.

3. **AgentBreeder vs DIY (Docker+Terraform)** -- Focus on: lines of code, time to deploy, governance out of the box, framework agnosticism, team collaboration.

4. **AgentBreeder vs Vellum** -- Focus on: open source vs proprietary, framework freedom, self-hosted option, no vendor lock-in, full code access.

Each comparison page should include:
- Feature matrix table
- Honest assessment of when the competitor is a better fit
- Code/config comparison where applicable
- "When to choose AgentBreeder" section

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Four comparison pages published in `docs/comparisons/`
- [ ] Each page has a feature matrix table
- [ ] Pages are factually accurate (no straw-man arguments)
- [ ] Each page includes a "When to choose [competitor]" section for honesty

### Issue 22: Cost Dashboard

**Priority:** P0
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `dashboard`

**Description:**
Build a comprehensive cost tracking dashboard in the web UI. Cost opacity is the #2 developer pain point with AI agents (after deployment complexity). AgentBreeder's cost tracking is a key differentiator and must be surfaced prominently.

The dashboard should show:
- **Per-agent cost:** Total cost, cost trend (7d/30d/90d), cost per request
- **Per-model cost:** Breakdown by model (Claude, GPT-4, etc.), input vs output tokens
- **Per-team cost:** Team-level aggregation for budget management
- **Cost alerts:** Configurable thresholds with email/Slack notifications
- **Cost anomaly detection:** Flag agents with sudden cost spikes
- **Budget tracking:** Set monthly budgets per team/agent, show burn rate
- **Export:** CSV/JSON export for finance teams

Data sources: the existing cost tracking in `api/routes/costs.py` and `api/services/`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Dashboard page at `/costs` with all views listed above
- [ ] Per-agent, per-model, and per-team cost breakdowns are accurate
- [ ] Cost trend charts render for 7d, 30d, and 90d windows
- [ ] Cost alerts are configurable and trigger notifications
- [ ] Anomaly detection flags agents with > 2x cost increase
- [ ] Budget tracking shows burn rate and projected overage
- [ ] CSV/JSON export works
- [ ] Dashboard loads in < 2 seconds for orgs with 100+ agents
- [ ] Unit tests for cost calculation logic
- [ ] E2E tests for dashboard rendering

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks (1 frontend + 1 backend engineer)

### Issue 23: Marketplace MVP

**Priority:** P1
**Labels:** `epic`, `marketplace`, `revenue`

**Description:**
Build the community marketplace for sharing and discovering agent templates. The marketplace enables a network effect: every template published makes AgentBreeder more valuable for all users.

MVP features:

1. **Publishing:** `garden publish` CLI command packages an agent template (agent.yaml + code + README + tests) and publishes it to the marketplace. Requires a verified account.

2. **Browsing:** Web UI and CLI (`garden search --marketplace`) for discovering templates. Categories, tags, search, and sorting (stars, downloads, recency).

3. **Installing:** `garden init --template marketplace:<author>/<name>` installs a marketplace template locally.

4. **Featured templates:** Curated section of high-quality templates maintained by the AgentBreeder team.

5. **Quality gates:** Published templates must pass `garden validate`, include a README, and include at least one test.

Future (not MVP): ratings/reviews, paid templates, verified publishers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `garden publish` packages and uploads a template
- [ ] Marketplace web UI shows browsable template catalog
- [ ] Search works by name, tag, framework, and description
- [ ] `garden init --template marketplace:<author>/<name>` installs a template
- [ ] Featured templates section is curated
- [ ] Quality gates enforce validation, README, and test requirements
- [ ] Published templates display download count and star count
- [ ] API endpoints in `api/routes/marketplace.py` are functional
- [ ] Unit and integration tests
- [ ] Documentation for publishing and consuming marketplace templates

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 weeks (2 engineers + 1 designer)

## Legal & IP Issues

---

### Issue 24: File Patent Provisionals

**Priority:** P0
**Labels:** `legal`, `ip`

**Description:**
File three provisional patent applications to protect AgentBreeder's core innovations. Provisional patents establish a priority date and provide 12 months to file full utility patents. This is critical IP protection before public launch.

Patent applications:

1. **Three-Tier Builder with Bidirectional Ejection**
   - System and method for a three-tier agent development interface (No Code, Low Code, Full Code) where all tiers compile to the same internal representation
   - Bidirectional tier mobility: No Code generates editable YAML (Low Code), Low Code ejects to SDK code (Full Code), and all tiers share the same deploy pipeline
   - The deploy pipeline is tier-agnostic

2. **MCP Sidecar Injection**
   - System and method for automatically injecting a sidecar container alongside deployed AI agents
   - The sidecar intercepts all MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool calls for observability, cost attribution, and guardrail enforcement
   - Automatic injection without agent code modification

3. **Automatic Inter-Agent Tool Synthesis**
   - System and method for automatically generating tool interfaces between agents in a multi-agent orchestration
   - Given two agent definitions, the system synthesizes the API contract, authentication, and data transformation needed for one agent to call another as a tool
   - Uses A2A Agent Cards for discovery and contract generation

Budget: $10,000-$16,000 (approximately $3,500-$5,500 per provisional, including patent attorney fees).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Patent attorney engaged and retained
- [ ] Technical disclosure documents written for all three inventions
- [ ] Prior art search completed for each invention
- [ ] Three provisional patent applications filed with USPTO
- [ ] Filing receipts and serial numbers documented
- [ ] 12-month deadline for full utility patent filing calendared
- [ ] Budget tracked and within $10K-$16K range

**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 weeks (founder + patent attorney)

### Issue 25: Publish Defensive Blog Posts

**Priority:** P1
**Labels:** `legal`, `content`

**Description:**
Publish detailed technical blog posts for six innovations to establish publicly dated prior art. These posts serve as defensive publications -- if AgentBreeder cannot or chooses not to patent an innovation, the blog post prevents others from patenting it.

Blog posts to write:

1. **agent.yaml Schema Design** -- Detailed explanation of the agent.yaml specification, design decisions, and the philosophy of declarative agent configuration. Include the full schema with rationale for each field.

2. **secret:// URI Resolution** -- Technical deep dive into the `secret://` URI scheme for resolving secrets from multiple backends (env, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, HashiCorp Vault) at deploy time.

3. **Multi-Cloud Deployer Abstraction** -- Architecture of the deployer interface and how a single `agent.yaml` deploys to Docker Compose, ECS Fargate, Cloud Run, or Kubernetes without changes.

4. **Provider Fallback Chains** -- How AgentBreeder implements model provider fallback (primary -> fallback -> gateway) with automatic failover, health checking, and cost-aware routing.

5. **RFC 8594 API Versioning** -- Implementation of API versioning with deprecation headers following RFC 8594, enabling smooth API evolution without breaking clients.

6. **Org-Wide Registry Architecture** -- Design of the unified registry for agents, prompts, tools, MCP servers, models, and knowledge bases, enabling org-wide discovery and dependency resolution.

Each post must include: publication date, detailed technical description, code examples, architecture diagrams, and design rationale.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All six blog posts published on a publicly accessible, date-stamped platform
- [ ] Each post includes sufficient technical detail to serve as prior art
- [ ] Each post includes code examples and/or architecture diagrams
- [ ] Posts are archived on the Wayback Machine (archive.org) for permanence
