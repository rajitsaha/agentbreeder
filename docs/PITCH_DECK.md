## Slide 1: Title

### AgentBreeder

**The Vercel for AI Agents**

*Define Once. Deploy Anywhere. Govern Automatically.*

An open-source platform for building, deploying, and governing enterprise AI agents.

**Seeking: [AMOUNT] Seed Round**

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### AI agents are easy to build. Deploying them to production is a nightmare.

Every enterprise AI team hits the same wall:

| Pain Point | Reality |
|---|---|
| **Pilot-to-production gap** | 67% of companies report gains from AI agent pilots, but only **10% successfully scale to production** |
| **ROI failure** | **95% of generative AI pilots fail to deliver measurable ROI** (MIT Sloan) |
| **Zero governance** | RBAC, audit trails, cost tracking all require manual setup --- on EVERY framework, EVERY cloud, EVERY agent |
| **Framework fragmentation** | 15+ frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, OpenAI Agents, Google ADK, Claude SDK...), each with its own deployment story --- which is to say, none |
| **Cloud lock-in** | AWS Bedrock and GCP Vertex deploy agents, but lock you into one provider forever |

**The "last mile" from prototype to production is where AI agent projects go to die.**

> "The biggest pain points we find are repeatability and hallucinations."
> --- Enterprise AI leaders

The demand is real: **Gartner reports a 1,445% surge in multi-agent system inquiries from Q1 2024 to Q2 2025.** Companies want to deploy agents. They just can't.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

### One YAML file. One command. Any framework. Any cloud. Governed automatically.

```yaml
# agent.yaml --- this is the entire configuration
name: customer-support-agent
framework: langgraph
model:
  primary: claude-sonnet-4
  fallback: gpt-4o
tools:
  - ref: tools/zendesk-mcp
  - ref: tools/order-lookup
deploy:
  cloud: aws
  scaling: { min: 1, max: 10 }
```

```bash
$ garden deploy

Validating agent.yaml...          OK
Checking RBAC permissions...      OK
Resolving dependencies...         OK (3 tools, 1 model, 2 knowledge bases)
Building container image...       OK (langgraph runtime, 847MB)
Provisioning infrastructure...    OK (ECS Fargate, us-east-1)
Deploying + health check...       OK
Registering in org registry...    OK

Agent live at: https://agents.company.com/customer-support-agent
Cost tracking: enabled | Audit trail: enabled | RBAC: enforced
```

**That's it.** RBAC, audit logging, cost attribution, and registry entry --- all automatic. Zero extra configuration.

---

## Slide 4: How It Works

### The Deploy Pipeline --- Atomic, Governed, Reversible

```
Parse & Validate YAML
    |
    v
RBAC Check (fail fast if unauthorized)
    |
    v
Dependency Resolution (fetch all refs from org registry)
    |
    v
Container Build (framework-specific Dockerfile)
    |
    v
Infrastructure Provision (Pulumi IaC)
    |
    v
Deploy + Health Check
    |
    v
Auto-Register in Org Registry
    |
    v
Return Endpoint URL
```

**Key properties:**

- **Atomic**: every step succeeds or the entire deploy rolls back. No half-deployed agents.
- **Governance is a side effect**: deploying automatically creates the audit trail, cost attribution, and registry entry. There is no "ungoverned deploy."
- **Framework-agnostic**: the pipeline doesn't care if you wrote your agent in LangGraph, CrewAI, OpenAI Agents, Claude SDK, Google ADK, or raw Python. It builds and deploys them all the same way.
- **Multi-cloud**: AWS ECS/Lambda and GCP Cloud Run are equal first-class targets. Kubernetes support is on the roadmap.

---

## Slide 5: Three-Tier Builder Model

### No Code. Low Code. Full Code. Same pipeline. Full mobility.

| Tier | Who | How They Build | Deploy Path |
|------|-----|----------------|-------------|
| **No Code** | PMs, Analysts, Citizen Builders | Visual drag-and-drop canvas in the dashboard | Generates `agent.yaml` --> deploy pipeline |
| **Low Code** | ML Engineers, DevOps | Write/edit `agent.yaml` in any IDE or the dashboard editor | `agent.yaml` IS the config --> deploy pipeline |
| **Full Code** | Senior Engineers, Researchers | Python/TS SDK with full programmatic control | SDK generates `agent.yaml` + bundles code --> deploy pipeline |

**All three tiers compile to the same internal representation and share the same deploy pipeline, governance, and observability.**

**Tier mobility is a first-class feature:**
- Start in the visual builder (No Code)
- Click "View YAML" to see exactly what was generated (Low Code)
- Run `garden eject` to get full SDK scaffolding (Full Code)
- No lock-in at any level. Move freely between tiers.

This is how you serve the entire organization --- from the PM who wants to prototype a support agent in 10 minutes to the ML engineer who needs custom routing logic.

---

## Slide 6: Product Demo

### From zero to governed, deployed agent in 90 seconds

**Step 1:** Start the entire platform locally

```bash
$ garden up
Starting AgentBreeder...
  PostgreSQL    .... running (port 5432)
  Redis         .... running (port 6379)
  API Server    .... running (port 8000)
  Dashboard     .... running (port 3000)

AgentBreeder is ready at http://localhost:3000
```

**Step 2:** Scaffold from a template

```bash
$ garden init --template customer-support
Created ./customer-support-agent/
  agent.yaml          # Pre-configured for LangGraph + Claude
  prompts/system.md   # Battle-tested support prompt
  tools/              # Zendesk + order lookup MCP servers
```

**Step 3:** Deploy with full governance

```bash
$ garden deploy --target local
Agent live at http://localhost:8080/customer-support-agent
Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/agents/customer-support-agent
```

**Step 4:** Open the dashboard

The dashboard shows: agent status, real-time cost tracking, full audit trail, connected MCP tools, and fleet-wide observability --- all populated automatically from the deploy.

---

## Slide 7: Why Now?

### Five forces converging to create a massive market opportunity

**1. Market inflection**
The AI agent market is exploding: **$7.6B (2025) --> $52.6B (2030) --> $183B (2033)**. That's a **46.3% CAGR** over 8 years. We are at the very beginning.

**2. Standards are converging**
MCP (Model Context Protocol) has **97M+ npm downloads** and is now under the Linux Foundation alongside A2A (Agent-to-Agent). AgentBreeder supports both protocols natively. The standardization wave is creating the opportunity for a deployment layer.

**3. Enterprise urgency**
**85% of organizations** are already using AI agents in some capacity. **40% plan to embed agents in customer-facing applications by end of 2026** (Gartner). But governance tools do not exist. Every enterprise is building this internally, poorly, from scratch.

**4. Framework fatigue**
15+ agent frameworks, zero deployment solutions. Developers are exhausted from re-inventing deployment for every framework. They want a `garden deploy` that just works.

**5. The "Kubernetes moment" for AI agents**
Just as Kubernetes standardized container orchestration (and created a $7B+ ecosystem), the AI agent deployment layer needs a standard. AgentBreeder is that standard.

---

## Slide 8: Market Size

```
TAM: $183B
Total AI agent market by 2033
(MarketsandMarkets, Grand View Research)

    SAM: $40B
    Agentic AI infrastructure layer
    (deployment, orchestration, governance, observability)

        SOM (Year 1-2): $5-20M
        5,000-20,000 active developers
        500+ paying teams
```

### Comparable valuations in adjacent categories

| Company | Category | Valuation | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Vercel** | Frontend deployment | **$9.3B** | "Deploy frontend in one command" --- we do the same for AI agents |
| **Grafana Labs** | Open-source observability | **$6B** | Open core model, developer-first --- identical playbook |
| **Supabase** | Open-source BaaS | **$5B** | OSS + hosted cloud --- same business model |
| **LangChain** | AI framework | **$1.25B** | Proved the market for AI dev tools --- we are the deployment layer they lack |
| **HashiCorp** | Infrastructure automation | **$6.4B** (IBM acq.) | Open core + enterprise governance --- exact same motion |

---

## Slide 9: Competitive Landscape

### Nobody does what we do.

| Capability | AgentBreeder | LangChain/LangSmith | Dify | Vertex AI Agent Builder | AWS Bedrock Agents |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Framework-agnostic** | 6 frameworks | Own framework only | Own framework only | GCP SDK only | AWS SDK only |
| **Multi-cloud** | AWS + GCP (K8s planned) | None | Self-hosted only | GCP only | AWS only |
| **Automatic governance** | Built-in (RBAC, audit, cost) | None | None | Manual IAM config | Manual IAM config |
| **Visual + YAML + SDK** | All 3 tiers | Code only | Visual only | Console + code | Console + code |
| **MCP native** | Sidecar injection | Plugin system | None | None | None |
| **A2A protocol** | Built-in | None | None | None | None |
| **Open source** | Apache 2.0 | Partial (MIT core) | Custom license | Proprietary | Proprietary |
| **One-command deploy** | `garden deploy` | No | No | No | No |

**Our moat**: AgentBreeder is the only platform that is simultaneously framework-agnostic, multi-cloud, and governance-first. Competitors optimize for one axis. We optimize for the intersection --- which is exactly what enterprises need.

## Slide 13: IP and Defensibility

### 3 patent filings in progress + open-source moat

**Patent Portfolio**

| Filing | Novelty | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Three-Tier Builder with Bidirectional Ejection** | HIGH --- no prior art found | System for converting between visual, declarative, and programmatic agent definitions with full round-trip fidelity |
| **MCP Sidecar Injection** | MODERATE-HIGH | Automatic injection of observability + governance sidecars into agent containers at deploy time |
| **Automatic Inter-Agent Tool Synthesis** | MODERATE | Method for automatically generating tool interfaces between agents in a multi-agent system |
| **Governance-Fused Deployment Pipeline** | System patent | Deployment system where governance (RBAC, audit, cost) is an atomic, non-optional step in the deploy pipeline |

**Open-Source Moat**

Apache 2.0 license with patent grant creates community trust while maintaining IP protection. The open-source adoption IS the moat:

- **Network effects**: the more agents deployed on AgentBreeder, the more valuable the registry, marketplace, and MCP ecosystem become
- **Switching costs**: once teams build their agent fleet on AgentBreeder (YAML configs, registry entries, governance policies), migration cost is high --- like Terraform
- **Community supply**: marketplace templates, MCP servers, and framework runtimes contributed by the community create supply-side lock-in
- **Data moat**: fleet-wide analytics across thousands of agents creates proprietary insights no competitor can replicate

---

## Slide 16: Comparable Exits and Returns

### The open-core developer tools playbook produces massive outcomes

| Company | Model | Valuation / Exit | Revenue | Multiple |
|---------|-------|-------------------|---------|----------|
| **HashiCorp** | Open core (Terraform, Vault) | **$6.4B** (acquired by IBM) | ~$600M ARR | ~10x |
| **Grafana Labs** | Open core (Grafana, Loki) | **$6B** | ~$300M ARR | ~20x |
| **Vercel** | Framework + cloud (Next.js) | **$9.3B** | $200M+ ARR | ~45x |
| **Supabase** | Open-source BaaS | **$5B** | Growing rapidly | --- |
| **LangChain** | AI dev framework | **$1.25B** | Early revenue | --- |
| **Docker** | Container platform | **IPO expected** | $135M+ ARR | --- |
| **Databricks** | Open-source data + AI | **$62B** | $2.4B+ ARR | ~25x |
| **Confluent** | Open core (Kafka) | **$9B** (peak) | $800M+ ARR | ~11x |

**The pattern is clear:** open-source developer infrastructure companies that become the default in their category achieve $5-60B+ outcomes. AgentBreeder is positioned to be the default for AI agent deployment --- a market that is 10x larger than any of the above at the same stage.

```

### Key technical differentiators

- **Atomic deploy pipeline**: every step succeeds or everything rolls back. No half-deployed agents.
- **Framework-agnostic runtimes**: `engine/runtimes/` abstracts all framework differences behind a common `RuntimeBuilder` interface.
- **MCP sidecar injection**: MCP tool servers are automatically packaged and injected as sidecar containers alongside the agent.
- **A2A protocol**: agents can discover and call each other via JSON-RPC, with authentication and agent cards.
- **Pluggable secrets**: environment variables, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, and HashiCorp Vault --- same `secret://` URI syntax everywhere.

---

## Appendix B: Why Open Source Wins

### The data is unambiguous

| Project | GitHub Stars | Valuation | Insight |
|---------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| LangChain | 100k+ | $1.25B | Framework popularity drives valuation even before revenue |
| Supabase | 75k+ | $5B | Open-source alternative to Firebase captured massive developer trust |
| Docker | Ubiquitous | $135M+ ARR, IPO track | Became the standard through free adoption, monetized enterprise |
| Terraform | 42k+ | $6.4B (HashiCorp acq.) | Open core + enterprise governance = massive exit |
| Kubernetes | 112k+ | Created $7B+ ecosystem | Open standard becomes the platform everything else builds on |

### Why open source is the ONLY viable strategy for AgentBreeder

1. **Trust**: enterprises will not hand their agent deployment pipeline to a closed-source vendor. The blast radius is too high. Open source means they can audit, fork, and self-host.

2. **Distribution**: a `pip install agentbreeder` and a GitHub star costs us nothing. Paid marketing to reach 10,000 developers costs millions. Open source is the most efficient GTM in developer tools.

3. **Community supply**: every MCP server, agent template, and framework runtime contributed by the community makes AgentBreeder more valuable for everyone. This flywheel cannot be replicated by a closed-source product.

4. **Talent signal**: the best engineers want to work on open-source projects. Our GitHub becomes our recruiting pipeline.

5. **Standard-setting**: the deployment layer for AI agents will be an open standard or it will not exist. Proprietary deployment tools will balkanize the market. AgentBreeder, as an open standard, can unify it.

**The playbook**: free core drives mass adoption --> cloud platform captures convenience revenue --> enterprise licenses capture governance revenue --> marketplace captures ecosystem revenue.
