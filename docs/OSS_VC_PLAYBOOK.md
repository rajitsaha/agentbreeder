# Open Source + VC Funding Playbook
**How to Build a VC-Backed Company Around AgentBreeder**

---

## 1. The Open-Source Business Playbook

### Why VCs Fund Open Source
- Open source is the most efficient developer distribution channel ever created
- Five open-core companies reached unicorn valuations: Supabase ($5B), Grafana ($6B), Sentry ($1B), Hasura ($1B), PlanetScale ($1B)
- HashiCorp: open-core to $6.4B acquisition by IBM
- Docker, Elastic, MongoDB, Redis, Confluent -- all built on open-source foundations
- VCs love open source because: (1) community = free distribution, (2) stars/usage = measurable traction, (3) open code = technical validation, (4) enterprise upsell = clear revenue path

### The Proven Model: Open Core
**Free (open source):**
- Core engine, CLI, all framework runtimes
- Local deployment (Docker Compose)
- Basic RBAC, audit logs, registry
- Community support (GitHub Issues, Discord)

**Paid (proprietary or hosted):**
- Managed cloud deployment platform ("AgentBreeder Cloud")
- Enterprise governance (SSO/SAML, compliance exports, approval workflows)
- Premium observability (fleet analytics, anomaly detection, cost optimization)
- Marketplace fees (15-20% on premium templates)
- Support SLAs, dedicated channels

### Key Rule: The Free Tier Must Be Genuinely Valuable
- Vercel's free tier: unlimited projects, 100GB bandwidth, preview deployments
- Supabase's free tier: 2 projects, 500MB database, 50K monthly active users
- AgentBreeder's free tier: unlimited agents, unlimited frameworks, full local deployment, basic governance
- If the free tier is crippled, developers won't adopt and the flywheel never starts

## 2. Legal Structure & Licensing

### Step 1: Incorporate
- **Delaware C-Corp** is the standard for VC-backed companies (required by most VCs)
- Use a service like Stripe Atlas ($500), Clerky, or a startup attorney
- Issue founder shares with 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff (standard)
- Set aside 10-15% equity for an employee stock option pool (VCs will require this)

### Step 2: Choose the Right License
**Recommended: Apache 2.0**
- Most permissive standard open-source license
- Includes explicit patent grant (Section 3) -- gives contributors and users patent protection
- Used by Kubernetes, TensorFlow, Spark, LangChain
- VCs are comfortable with Apache 2.0

**Alternatives and why NOT to use them:**
- **MIT**: Too simple, no patent grant. Apache 2.0 is strictly better for a platform.
- **AGPL/GPL**: Scares enterprises. Kills enterprise adoption.
- **BSL (Business Source License)**: Used by HashiCorp (which triggered the OpenTofu fork), MariaDB, Sentry. Prevents cloud providers from offering your product as a service. Controversial -- splits community.
- **SSPL (Server Side Public License)**: Used by MongoDB, Elastic. Even more controversial. Not OSI-approved.
- **Custom "fair source"**: Used by Dify, n8n. Confuses developers. Not truly open source.

**For AgentBreeder: Apache 2.0 for the core platform. Proprietary license for the cloud platform and enterprise features.**

### Step 3: Copyright & IP Assignment
- All contributors should sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
- CLA assigns copyright to the company (or grants broad license)
- Use a CLA bot (like CLA Assistant by SAP) to automate this on GitHub
- This ensures the company owns the IP needed for patent filings and dual licensing

### Step 4: Trademark
- Register "AgentBreeder" as a trademark (USPTO, ~$250-350 per class)
- Trademarks protect the brand even though the code is open source
- Red Hat, Docker, Kubernetes -- all have strong trademark protection
- Include trademark guidelines in the repo (TRADEMARK.md)

## 3. VC Fundraising Process

### Pre-Seed / Seed Stage (Where AgentBreeder Is)
**What VCs want to see:**

- Early traction signals (GitHub stars, downloads, community size)
- Clear revenue model (open core + cloud + marketplace)
- Large market ($52B by 2030, $183B by 2033)
- Founder-market fit (deep AI/platform engineering experience)

**Typical seed terms:**
- Raise: $2-5M
- Valuation: $10-25M (pre-money)
- Dilution: 15-25%
- Instrument: SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) or priced round
- Timeline: 12-18 months runway

- a16z (invested in LangChain, GitHub, Hugging Face)
- Benchmark (invested in LangChain)
- Sequoia (invested in LangChain)
- Insight Partners (invested in CrewAI)
- Bessemer (invested in Relevance AI)
- Spark Capital (invested in Wordware)

### Fundraising Process Step-by-Step

1. **Build the deck** (see PITCH_DECK.md)
2. **Build a target list** of 50-80 investors (use Signal, Crunchbase, or VC fund websites)
3. **Get warm introductions** -- cold emails have <5% response rate. Warm intros through:
   - YC network (if accepted)
   - Other founders
   - Angel investors
   - LinkedIn connections to partners
4. **Run the process in 2-3 weeks** -- create urgency by scheduling all meetings in a compressed window
5. **First meeting (30 min)**: Tell the story. Problem -> Solution -> Demo -> Market -> Ask.
6. **Second meeting (60 min)**: Deep dive. Technical architecture, competitive landscape, go-to-market, team.
7. **Partner meeting**: Present to the full partnership. This is the decision meeting.
8. **Term sheet**: Negotiate valuation, board seats, protective provisions, pro-rata rights.
9. **Due diligence**: Investors review code, IP, corporate structure, cap table.
10. **Close**: Sign docs, wire funds (4-8 weeks from first meeting to close is fast; 2-3 months is typical).

### What to Have Ready Before Fundraising
- [ ] Delaware C-Corp incorporated
- [ ] Cap table clean (use Carta or Pulley)
- [ ] Pitch deck (see PITCH_DECK.md)
- [ ] Financial model (simple: 3-year revenue projections, unit economics)
- [ ] Product demo (working `garden up` -> `garden deploy` flow)
- [ ] GitHub repo public with README, contributing guide, license
- [ ] Patent provisionals filed (shows IP awareness)
- [ ] Data room (Google Drive/Notion): deck, financials, cap table, legal docs, technical architecture

## 6. Protecting the Business While Staying Open

### The "AWS Problem"
Fear: AWS/GCP takes your open-source code and offers it as a managed service, undercutting you.
Reality: This happened to MongoDB, Elastic, Redis, and they all adopted more restrictive licenses.

**AgentBreeder's defense strategy:**
1. **Apache 2.0 for core** -- maximizes adoption and trust
2. **Proprietary cloud platform** -- the managed hosting, enterprise features, and cloud UI are NOT open source
3. **Speed** -- ship faster than cloud providers can copy. AWS Bedrock AgentCore exists but is AWS-only. AgentBreeder's multi-cloud advantage is structural.
4. **Community** -- a thriving open-source community is a moat. Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform all survived despite cloud provider competition because the community trusts the original project.
5. **Brand/trademark** -- "AgentBreeder" is trademarked. Nobody else can use the name for a competing service.
6. **Patents** -- defensive patents prevent cloud providers from blocking you. Patent pledge prevents community backlash.

### Revenue Segmentation
Keep a clear bright line between what's free and what's paid:

**Always free:**
- Everything that runs on a developer's laptop
- Core engine, CLI, framework runtimes, local deployers
- Basic governance (RBAC, audit logs)
- Community templates

**Always paid:**
- Managed multi-cloud deployment
- Enterprise SSO/SAML
- Compliance exports
- SLA support
- Private marketplace
- Fleet management dashboard

This bright line must be maintained even under revenue pressure. Crossing it destroys community trust.
