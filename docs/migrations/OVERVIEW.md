# Migration Guides -- Agent Garden

> Bring your existing AI agents to Agent Garden in minutes.
> Your framework code stays the same. Agent Garden wraps it with governance, multi-cloud deploy, and org-wide discoverability.

## Why Migrate?

You already built an agent. It works. But now you need:

| Challenge | Without Agent Garden | With Agent Garden |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Deploy to production** | Write Dockerfiles, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines | `garden deploy agent.yaml` |
| **Multi-cloud** | Rewrite infra per cloud provider | Change one line: `cloud: aws` or `cloud: gcp` |
| **RBAC & access control** | Build from scratch or skip it | Automatic -- every deploy checks permissions |
| **Cost tracking** | Manual token counting, spreadsheets | Per-agent, per-team, per-model cost attribution |
| **Audit trail** | Hope someone wrote it down | Every deploy, invocation, and config change logged |
| **Agent discovery** | Slack messages asking "who built that agent?" | Org-wide searchable registry |
| **Guardrails** | Roll your own PII detection, content filters | Declarative: `guardrails: [pii_detection]` |
| **Model fallbacks** | Try/catch with hardcoded alternatives | `model: { primary: claude-sonnet-4, fallback: gpt-4o }` |
| **Scaling** | Configure autoscaling per cloud | `scaling: { min: 1, max: 10, target_cpu: 70 }` |

**What Agent Garden does NOT do:** It does not replace your framework. Your LangGraph graphs, CrewAI crews, OpenAI agents, and custom code run exactly as-is inside the container Agent Garden builds. Think of it as the deployment and governance layer that sits around your agent.

## Quick Decision Matrix

| You're using... | Migration time | Difficulty | Guide |
|----------------|---------------|------------|-------|
| **LangGraph** | ~15 minutes | Easy | [FROM_LANGGRAPH.md](./FROM_LANGGRAPH.md) |
| **CrewAI** | ~20 minutes | Easy | [FROM_CREWAI.md](./FROM_CREWAI.md) |
| **OpenAI Agents SDK** | ~15 minutes | Easy | [FROM_OPENAI_AGENTS.md](./FROM_OPENAI_AGENTS.md) |
| **Microsoft AutoGen** | ~30 minutes | Moderate | [FROM_AUTOGEN.md](./FROM_AUTOGEN.md) |
| **Custom Python agent** | ~20 minutes | Easy | [FROM_CUSTOM.md](./FROM_CUSTOM.md) |
| **No existing agent** | ~5 minutes | Trivial | Use `garden init` to scaffold |

## 5-Minute Quick Start (Any Framework)

Regardless of your framework, the migration follows the same three steps:

### Step 1: Keep your agent code

```
my-agent/
  agent.py          # <-- your existing code, unchanged
  requirements.txt  # <-- your existing deps
```

### Step 2: Add agent.yaml

```yaml
name: my-agent
version: 1.0.0
team: my-team
owner: me@company.com
framework: langgraph  # or crewai, openai_agents, custom

model:
  primary: gpt-4o

deploy:
  cloud: local
```

### Step 3: Deploy

```bash
pip install agent-garden
garden deploy agent.yaml
```

That is the entire migration. Everything else -- RBAC, registry, cost tracking, health checks -- happens automatically.

## What Stays the Same After Migration

This is important: **Agent Garden does not modify your agent code.** Your framework-specific logic runs inside a container that AG builds and manages. Specifically:

- Your `agent.py` / `main.py` files are unchanged
- Your `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` are preserved (AG adds framework deps if missing)
- Your LLM API calls go through the same providers
- Your tools, prompts, and logic are identical
- You can still run your agent locally without Agent Garden (just `python agent.py`)

What AG adds is a server wrapper (`server.py`) that exposes your agent as an HTTP service with `/invoke` and `/health` endpoints, plus the deploy infrastructure.

## Architecture: How It Works

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to rewrite my agent?**
No. Your agent code is unchanged. You add an `agent.yaml` file and run `garden deploy`.

**Q: Can I still run my agent without Agent Garden?**
Yes. Your `agent.py` still works standalone. Agent Garden is additive.

**Q: What if my framework isn't listed?**
Use `framework: custom`. See [FROM_CUSTOM.md](./FROM_CUSTOM.md). Any Python agent that can be called via a function works.

**Q: Does Agent Garden lock me in?**
No. Your agent code has zero Agent Garden imports. The `agent.yaml` is a declarative config file. You can stop using AG at any time and deploy your container manually.

**Q: What about multi-agent systems?**
Agent Garden has `orchestration.yaml` for defining multi-agent workflows (sequential, parallel, router, supervisor, fan-out/fan-in). Your framework's native orchestration (LangGraph subgraphs, CrewAI processes, OpenAI handoffs) also works as-is inside the container.
