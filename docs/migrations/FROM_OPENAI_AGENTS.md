# Migrate from OpenAI Agents SDK to Agent Garden

> **Time to migrate:** ~15 minutes
> **Difficulty:** Easy
> **What changes:** You add an `agent.yaml` file. Your OpenAI Agents SDK code stays exactly the same.

---

## Before You Start

- [ ] You have an existing OpenAI Agents SDK agent (using the `openai-agents` package)
- [ ] Your agent code is in `agent.py` or `main.py` with `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Python 3.11+ is installed
- [ ] Docker is installed and running
- [ ] You have installed Agent Garden: `pip install agent-garden`

---

## The Big Picture

The OpenAI Agents SDK gives you a clean API for building agents with `Agent`, `Runner`, `function_tool`, and `Handoff`. Agent Garden does not replace any of that. It wraps your agent in a production container and adds everything you need for enterprise deployment: RBAC, cost tracking, health checks, model fallbacks, and org-wide discoverability.

**Key insight:** Your agent's simplicity is preserved. Agent Garden adds zero imports to your code.

---

## Before & After

### Before: Raw OpenAI Agents SDK

```
my-agent/
  agent.py            # Agent + tools definition
  requirements.txt
  Dockerfile          # you wrote this
  fly.toml            # or render.yaml, or ECS task def...
```

### After: OpenAI Agents SDK + Agent Garden

```
my-agent/
  agent.py            # UNCHANGED
  requirements.txt    # UNCHANGED
  agent.yaml          # NEW -- the AG config
```

---

## Step-by-Step Migration

### Step 1: Verify your agent structure

Agent Garden accepts either `agent.py` or `main.py`. Your file should export an `agent` variable -- an `openai.agents.Agent` instance:

```python
# agent.py
from agents import Agent, function_tool

@function_tool
def lookup_order(order_id: str) -> str:
    """Look up an order by ID."""
    return f"Order {order_id}: shipped, arriving tomorrow"

agent = Agent(
    name="Support Agent",
    instructions="You are a helpful customer support agent...",
    tools=[lookup_order],
)
```

The variable must be named `agent`. If yours is named differently, add an alias:

```python
my_bot = Agent(name="My Bot", ...)
agent = my_bot  # alias for Agent Garden
```

### Step 2: Create agent.yaml

```yaml
name: support-agent
version: 1.0.0
description: "Customer support agent with order lookup"
team: support
owner: you@company.com
tags: [openai-agents, support, production]

framework: openai_agents

model:
  primary: gpt-4o
  fallback: gpt-4o-mini

tools:
  - name: lookup_order
    type: function
    description: "Look up an order by ID"

deploy:
  cloud: local
  secrets:
    - OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Step 3: Validate

```bash
garden validate agent.yaml
```

### Step 4: Deploy

```bash
garden deploy agent.yaml --target local
```

### Step 5: Test

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/invoke \
  -d '{"input": {"message": "Where is order #12345?"}}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

### Step 6: Deploy to cloud

```yaml
deploy:
  cloud: aws
  runtime: ecs-fargate
  region: us-east-1
  scaling:
    min: 1
    max: 10
    target_cpu: 70
  resources:
    cpu: "0.5"
    memory: "1Gi"
  secrets:
    - OPENAI_API_KEY
```

```bash
garden deploy agent.yaml --target aws
```

## Concept Mapping: OpenAI Agents SDK to Agent Garden

| OpenAI Agents Concept | Agent Garden Equivalent | Notes |
|----------------------|------------------------|-------|
| `Agent(name, instructions, tools)` | Export as `agent` in `agent.py` | AG wraps it; does not replace it |
| `Runner.run(agent, input)` | `POST /invoke` on deployed container | AG server wrapper calls Runner |
| `function_tool` | `tools:` in `agent.yaml` | Declare for documentation; implementation stays in your code |
| `Handoff` | `subagents:` in `agent.yaml` or `orchestration.yaml` | AG can also orchestrate handoffs at platform level |
| `Agent.model` | `model.primary` in `agent.yaml` | AG adds fallback, gateway, temperature |
| `Agent.instructions` | `prompts.system` in `agent.yaml` (optional) | Can reference versioned prompts from registry |
| `guardrail` decorator | `guardrails:` in `agent.yaml` | AG adds PII detection, content filter, hallucination check |
| `RunResult` | JSON response from `/invoke` | Same data, wrapped in AG response format |
| Streaming (`Runner.run_streamed`) | Streaming supported via AG server | SSE endpoint at `/stream` |
| `trace` / OpenAI tracing | AG tracing (OpenTelemetry) | Automatic, framework-agnostic |

---

## Handling Handoffs

The OpenAI Agents SDK has a `Handoff` mechanism for transferring control between agents. There are two ways to handle this with Agent Garden:

### Option A: Keep Handoffs in Your Code (Simple)

If your handoff agents are all defined in the same `agent.py`, they work as-is. Agent Garden deploys the entire file as one unit:

```python
# agent.py
from agents import Agent, Handoff, function_tool

billing_agent = Agent(
    name="Billing",
    instructions="Handle billing and payment questions.",
    tools=[lookup_invoice],
)

tech_agent = Agent(
    name="Tech Support",
    instructions="Handle technical issues.",
    tools=[check_status, restart_service],
)

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage",
    instructions="Route customer requests to the right specialist.",
    handoffs=[
        Handoff(target=billing_agent, description="Billing questions"),
        Handoff(target=tech_agent, description="Technical support"),
    ],
)

# Export the entry point agent
agent = triage_agent
```

```yaml
# agent.yaml
name: support-triage
framework: openai_agents
model:
  primary: gpt-4o
deploy:
  cloud: local
  secrets:
    - OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Option B: Separate Agents + AG Orchestration (Advanced)

Deploy each agent independently and use AG orchestration for cross-agent routing:

```yaml
# orchestration.yaml
name: support-router
version: 1.0.0
team: support
owner: you@company.com
strategy: router

agents:
  triage:
    ref: agents/triage-agent
    routes:
      - condition: "billing"
        target: billing
      - condition: "technical"
        target: tech-support
  billing:
    ref: agents/billing-agent
  tech-support:
    ref: agents/tech-support-agent

deploy:
  target: local
```

Benefits of Option B:
- Independent scaling (tech support might need more capacity than billing)
- Different teams can own different agents
- Per-agent cost tracking
- Mix frameworks (triage could be OpenAI Agents, billing could be LangGraph)

---

## Preserving the Simple OpenAI API

One of the OpenAI Agents SDK's strengths is its simplicity. Agent Garden preserves that completely:

**Your code before AG:**

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool

@function_tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get current weather for a city."""
    return f"72F and sunny in {city}"

agent = Agent(
    name="Weather Bot",
    instructions="Help users check the weather.",
    tools=[get_weather],
)

# Local testing
result = await Runner.run(agent, "What's the weather in SF?")
print(result.final_output)
```

**Your code after AG:**

```python
# Exactly the same file. Zero changes.
```

The only addition is `agent.yaml` next to it. You can still run `python agent.py` for local testing without any Agent Garden dependency.

---

## Adding Governance

### Model fallback (protects against OpenAI outages)

```yaml
model:
  primary: gpt-4o
  fallback: claude-sonnet-4
  gateway: litellm
```

With LiteLLM gateway, Agent Garden can transparently fall back to a non-OpenAI model. Your OpenAI Agents SDK code does not need to change -- the gateway translates the API.

### Guardrails

```yaml
guardrails:
  - pii_detection
  - content_filter
  - hallucination_check
```

These run as middleware around your agent's responses, before they reach the caller.

### Access control

```yaml
access:
  visibility: team
  allowed_callers:
    - team:support
  require_approval: false
```

### MCP servers (tool sidecar injection)

Attach MCP tool servers as sidecars to your agent:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  - ref: mcp/zendesk
    transport: stdio
  - ref: mcp/order-management
```

### Knowledge bases

```yaml
knowledge_bases:
  - ref: kb/product-docs
  - ref: kb/faq-database
```

## What You Gain

| Feature | OpenAI Agents SDK Only | + Agent Garden |
|---------|----------------------|----------------|
| Agent definition | `Agent()` | Same (unchanged) |
| Tool definition | `@function_tool` | Same (unchanged) |
| Running agent | `Runner.run()` | Same locally; HTTP endpoint in production |
| Deploy | Manual | `garden deploy agent.yaml` |
| Multi-cloud | Manual | One-line change |
| Model fallback | Not built-in | Declarative, cross-provider |
| RBAC | Not available | Automatic |
| Cost tracking | Not available | Per-agent, per-model |
| Guardrails | `@guardrail` decorator | Declarative + your custom guardrails |
| Agent discovery | Not available | Org-wide registry |
| Health checks | Not available | Automatic |
| Autoscaling | Manual | Declarative |
| Audit trail | Not available | Every invocation logged |
| Multi-agent orchestration | Handoffs (in-process) | Handoffs + cross-service orchestration |

## What Stays the Same

- Your `Agent` definitions (name, instructions, tools)
- Your `function_tool` implementations
- Your `Handoff` configurations
- Your `Runner.run()` invocations for local testing
- Your guardrail decorators (AG adds platform-level ones on top)
- Your ability to run standalone: `python agent.py`

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing agent.py or main.py"

Agent Garden accepts either filename. If your entry point is something else:

```python
# agent.py
from my_bot import agent  # re-export
```

### "No 'agent' variable found"

The AG server wrapper imports `agent` from your file. Make sure it is exported at module level:

```python
agent = Agent(name="My Agent", ...)  # must be at module level, not inside a function
```

### OpenAI API key not found in container

Add it to secrets:

```yaml
deploy:
  secrets:
    - OPENAI_API_KEY
```

For local deploy, set it in your environment before running `garden deploy`, or create a `.env` file in the agent directory.

### Streaming responses

The AG server wrapper supports streaming via Server-Sent Events. The `/stream` endpoint uses `Runner.run_streamed()` under the hood.

### Multiple agents in one file

If you have multiple agents with handoffs in one file, export the "entry point" agent (the one that receives initial input) as `agent`:

```python
agent = triage_agent  # the first agent that receives input
```

AG imports this agent and uses it as the entry point. Handoff targets are resolved from the same module automatically.

### Container health check fails

The default health check hits `/health` on port 8080. If your agent's dependencies take time to initialize (downloading models, connecting to databases), the check may time out. Ensure heavy initialization is lazy or happens at import time before the server starts.
