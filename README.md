Every team picks a different AI agent framework. Nobody knows what's already deployed. Nobody tracks the cost. AgentBreeder fixes that — one open-source platform to build, deploy, govern, and discover all your AI agents.

**Build agents your way — drag-and-drop, YAML, or code. Deploy and govern them all the same.**

---

## The Problem

- **Framework sprawl** — teams use LangGraph, CrewAI, Claude SDK, OpenAI Agents, Google ADK... each with its own deployment story
- **No discoverability** — five teams build five Salesforce tools because nobody knows the others exist
- **No cost visibility** — AI spend is a black box across teams, agents, and models
- **Governance is bolted on** — RBAC, audit trails, and compliance are always an afterthought
- **Skill gap** — PMs want to prototype agents, but only engineers can build them; engineers want full programmatic control, but are forced into limited UIs

## Three Ways to Build

AgentBreeder supports three builder tiers — No Code, Low Code, and Full Code — for both **individual agents** and **multi-agent orchestration**. All three tiers compile down to the same internal representation and share the same deploy pipeline, governance, and observability.

```
No Code (UI)  ──→  agent.yaml  ──→  garden deploy  ──→  running agent
Low Code (YAML) ──→  agent.yaml  ──→  garden deploy  ──→  running agent
Full Code (SDK) ──→  agent.yaml + code  ──→  garden deploy  ──→  running agent
```

| Tier | Who it's for | Agent Development | Agent Orchestration |
|------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **No Code** | PMs, analysts, citizen builders | Visual drag-and-drop: pick model, tools, prompt from registry | Visual canvas: wire agents together, define routing rules |
| **Low Code** | ML engineers, DevOps | YAML config (`agent.yaml`) in any IDE | YAML orchestration (`orchestration.yaml`) |
| **Full Code** | Senior engineers, researchers | Python/TS SDK with full programmatic control | SDK for complex workflows, dynamic routing, state machines |

**Tier mobility** is the key — start No Code, hit a wall, eject to YAML. Hit another wall, eject to Full Code. At every stage, the platform still manages deploy, governance, observability, and registry.

## How AgentBreeder Works

```
garden init  →  Write agent.yaml  →  garden deploy  →  Agent is live
```

Define your agent in a single YAML file:

```yaml
name: customer-support-agent
version: 1.0.0
team: customer-success
owner: alice@company.com

framework: langgraph

model:
  primary: claude-sonnet-4
  fallback: gpt-4o

tools:
  - ref: tools/zendesk-mcp
  - ref: tools/order-lookup

deploy:
  cloud: aws
  runtime: ecs-fargate
  scaling:
    min: 1
    max: 10
```

Run `garden deploy` and your agent is live on AWS or GCP — with RBAC, cost tracking, audit trail, and org-wide discoverability automatic and zero extra work.

- **Provider abstraction layer** -- OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), Ollama, and OpenRouter providers with automatic fallback chains (`engine/providers/`, `connectors/openrouter/`)
- **GCP Cloud Run deployer** -- `garden deploy --target cloud-run` for serverless container deployment
- **OpenAI Agents runtime** -- first-class support for the OpenAI Agents SDK (`engine/runtimes/openai_agents.py`)
- **Deploy from Dashboard** -- 8-step deploy pipeline dialog, no CLI required
- **Visual Agent Builder** -- ReactFlow canvas with 8 node types, drag-and-drop agent composition
- **RAG Builder** -- create RAG indexes, ingest files, hybrid search via the dashboard
- **Memory Builder** -- configure conversation memory, storage backends
- **Approval Workflow** -- PR review UI, environment promotion, approval gates
- **Test Prompt panel** -- test prompts against models with variables directly in the dashboard
- **Tool sandbox execution** -- safely execute tools in an isolated sandbox environment
- **Git workflow backend** -- git operations and PR lifecycle management from the API

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

### Install & Run

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/open-agentbreeder/agentbreeder.git
cd agentbreeder

# Set up Python environment
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
cp .env.example .env

# Start the local stack (postgres, redis, API, dashboard)
docker compose up -d

# Create your first agent
garden init

# Deploy locally
garden deploy ./agent.yaml --target local
```

Your agent is now running at `http://localhost:8080/agents/{name}/invoke` with a registry entry automatically created.

## Architecture

```
Developer                    AgentBreeder Platform                     Cloud

agent.yaml  ──>  [ CLI ]  ──>  [ API Server ]  ──>  [ Engine ]  ──>  [ AWS / GCP / K8s ]
                                      |                  |
                                      v                  v
                                [ PostgreSQL ]    [ Container Registry ]
                                  (Registry)             |
                                      |                  v
                                  [ Redis ]       [ Agent + Sidecar ]
                                  (Queue)
```

**The deploy pipeline** (every step is atomic — if any fails, the entire deploy rolls back):

1. Parse & validate YAML
2. RBAC check (fail fast if unauthorized)
3. Dependency resolution (fetch refs from registry)
4. Container build (framework-specific Dockerfile)
5. Infrastructure provision (Pulumi)
6. Deploy & health check
7. Auto-register in registry
8. Return endpoint URL
